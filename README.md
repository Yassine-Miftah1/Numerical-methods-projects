# Numerical-methods-projects
A curated collection of numerical methods projects tailored for mechanical engineering applications.  It features simulations, solvers, and analysis tools built in Python â€” tackling real-world problems like:  Dynamic systems (ODE integration: Runge-Kutta, Euler) / Vibrations and modal analysis  / Nonlinear systems and root-finding techniques.
